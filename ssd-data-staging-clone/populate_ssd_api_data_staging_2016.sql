ssd_api_data_staging - SCD Type-1 Current State Payload Store

Purpose:
This table stores the most recent|current CSC API payload per person to support
(daily) incremental refresh using hash-based change detection. Designed
to act as persistent state table not transient staging table

Design pattern:
Slowly Changing Dimension - Type 1 (SCD-1)
- One row per person_id represents current authoritative payload
- Payload changes overwrite current version in-place
- Limited history (previous payload + hash) kept for audit/debug

Core mechanics:
- SOURCE rows come from the derived cohort (RawPayloads / Hashed)
- TARGET rows live in ssd_api_data_staging
- Changes detected using SHA2_256 hash of JSON payload

Row lifecycle:
NEW        -> first time person appears in cohort
UPDATED    -> payload content changed (hash delta detected)
UNCHANGED  -> payload identical to previous run
DELETED    -> person no longer present in SOURCE set(SSD/STAT)

Change handling:
- On payload change:
    - json_payload is replaced
    - previous_json_payload and previous_hash are preserved
    - submission_status reset to 'Pending'
- On no change:
    - row preserved as-is
    - timestamps intentionally not churned

Soft delete semantics:
- Rows NOT MATCHED BY SOURCE are soft-deleted
- row_state set to 'Deleted'
- No physical deletes performed on ssd api staging table

Opt cohort restriction:
- An optional STAT return filter may be enabled in the MERGE SOURCE
- When enabled any person_id NOT in STAT table is treated as
  'not in source' and therefore soft-deleted

Timestamp semantics:
- last_updated represents the last *material payload change*
- Unchanged rows preserve last_updated across runs
- Deleted rows update last_updated when deletion happens

Op notes:
- Table is stateful and SHOULD NOT be truncated between runs
- UNIQUE idx on person_id enforces singular records
