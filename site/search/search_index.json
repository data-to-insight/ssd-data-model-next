There is no data sharing outside your LA, and no changes to your existing systems are required. Data tables(with data copied from the raw CMS tables) and indexes for the SSD are created, and therefore in some cases will need support and/or agreement from either your IT or Intelligence team. The SQL script is always non-destructive, i.e. it does nothing to your existing data/tables/anything - the SSD process is simply a series of SELECT statements, pulling copied data into a new standardised field and table structure on your own system for access by only you/your LA.  </p>"},{"location":"#getting-started-workflow","title":"Getting started workflow:","text":"<p>The development and deployment of the SSD is functional only within, and as a result of direct involvement with Local Authorities.
